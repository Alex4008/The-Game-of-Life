# The-Game-of-Life
Conway's Game of Life created as a project in my Computer Science 1 class at The University of Cincinnati. 

This project is built using the [Conway Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) rules. This was built for the purpose of getting extra credit in my Computer Science 1 class at The University of Cincinnati. I went way above and beyond the requirements and built a program that not only follows the rules of the 'game' but also has the edges wrap around to simulate a sphere like world.

The changelog for this project is located [here on my website](http://alexdgray.com/pages/projects/gameOfLifeDetails.php) This includes summaries of each version and screenshots from the development process!

This was a very simple program that implemented the algorithms and set of rules for Conway's Game of Life. While this was very simple and easy to create, I am thankful that I did it because it inspired me to create Maze Runner. Which is some of the most fun and challenging programming that I had done at that time.
