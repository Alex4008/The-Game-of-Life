# The-Game-of-Life
Conway's Game of Life created as a project in my Computer Science 1 class at The University of Cincinnati. 

This project is built using the [Conway Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) rules. This was built for the purpose of getting extra credit in my Computer Science 1 class at The University of Cincinnati. I went way above and beyond the requirements and built a program that not only follows the rules of the 'game' but also has the edges wrap around to simulate a sphere like world.

This program was based on a basic algorithm and set of rules as defined for Conway's Game of Life

The rules, taken from Wikipedia:
The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead, (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors, which are the cells that are horizontal, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur: 
* Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by under population.
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
* Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
* Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed; births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick. Each generation is a pure function of the preceding one. The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.

This was a very simple program that implemented the algorithms and set of rules for Conway's Game of Life. While this was very simple and easy to create, I am thankful that I did it because it inspired me to create Maze Runner. Which is some of the most fun and challenging programming that I had done at that time.
